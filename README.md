# Chabot-using-Markov-chain
Its a chatbot that is made to demonstarte the principles of markovs chain which is a stochastic model .
Markov chains, named after Andrey Markov, a stochastic model that depicts a sequence of possible events where predictions or probabilities for the next state are based solely on its previous event state, not the states before. In simple words, the probability that n+1th steps will be x depends only on the nth steps not the complete sequence of steps that came before n.
